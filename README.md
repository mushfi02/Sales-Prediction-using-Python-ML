Sales Prediction using Python or Machine Learning Models

# About Dataset 

The Advertising dataset contains historical data on advertising expenditures and corresponding sales for different channels. It includes columns for TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets, each in thousands of dollars, and sales, recorded in thousands of units. This dataset helps analyze how spending on various advertising channels impacts sales, providing valuable insights for marketing strategies. It is organized in a CSV file named "Advertising.csv," making it accessible for straightforward data analysis and interpretation.

# Conclusion

- In this task, I have used the Advertising Dataset to predict sales based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising budgets.

- I performed an analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between features and identify outliers.

- I trained several models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).

- The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with an R-squared value of 0.978260, indicating very high accuracy.

- I created a dataframe of actual and predicted values for each model to demonstrate their effectiveness.

- Finally, I visualized the actual and predicted sales values, showing a close match for the best-performing models and confirming their reliability.
